# Future Development

Concept  - Zelda unlocks unprecedented rewards and NFTs for users who can select their preferred brands as part of the registration process. 

The brands will represent the level of discount and equivalent mission success required to unlock these discounts. 

Once the discounts are unlocked the user has two choices 

1. Purchase any item from the retailer the discount represents 
2. Share the discount with family and gaming friends through a secure NFT code 

Win/win whether the user/gamer opts for option 1 or 2 they will accumulate NFTs if either they make a purchase with the brand discount unlocked or the discount unlocked is shared and subsequently used. 

If the gamer chooses option two which is to share the discount they will only accumulate NFTs and forfeit their discount but can continue to unlock new brand discounts as the game becomes more complex. 

The challenge
How can we make the game levels more complex to represent to enable the gamer to unlock new levels? 


The game idea 
The user moves through the maze/chess type board through preselected moves like chest against the AI based computer or pre-programmed chess type opponent.

The Wallet Explained based on the option the gamer opts to exercise 

OPT1
Wallet 1 represents option one above - This represent both the discount and Brand + the NFT reward once the purchase has been made with the retailer

 OPT2 
The gamer opts to share the discount which is forfeited/transfer but an NFT wallet in their favour is generated and the NFT is gained once the transferred discount is claimed. 

Conclusion 
Option 1 is where the gamer is able to earn/claim both discounts and NFT rewards whereas option two provides either the original gamer with an NFT (once discount transfer is used) or transferred discount.
